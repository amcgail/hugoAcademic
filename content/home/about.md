# Biography

How do social agents organize the (e)valuation of nonmarket goods, be it a scientific theory or a person’s moral worth? How do hierarchical relationships emerge from these practices of (e)valuation? My interests lie at the intersection of status inequality, evaluative cultures and knowledge production. Ultimately, my goal is to understand individuals’ sense making of the everyday world, and the link between individuals’ beliefs and social action. I draw on quantitative, ethnographic, and computational methods to answer my research questions. 

I grew up in Nanjing, a historical city in East China. I hold a master’s in Sociology from Oxford University and a B.A. in Communications at Fudan University, Shanghai. As an undergraduate, I was obsessed with continental philosophy, especially Kant. The idea of a sociology career began to fascinate me during my senior year, when I first read the works of Michèle Lamont and Eva Illouz.
