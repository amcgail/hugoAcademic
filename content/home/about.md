# Biography

How do social agents organize the (e)valuation of nonmarket goods, such as a scientific theory or a person’s moral worth? How do hierarchical relationships emerge from these evaluative practices? I am a sociology PhD student at Cornell whose interests lie at the intersection of inequality, culture and knowledge. Broadly, I study individuals’ sense-making of the everyday world, and the link between individuals’ beliefs and social action. I draw on quantitative, ethnographic, and computational methods to answer my research questions.
